Overview
This research project aims to develop and compare three machine learning (ML) models - Random Forest Classification, Neural Network Classification, and Logistic Regression - to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a dataset with 14 key attributes. This dataset, derived from four databases across Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and VA Long Beach, provides a valuable resource for understanding heart disease dynamics without compromising patient privacy, seeing as how the information is de-itentified and anonymized.

Objectives
Data Preprocessing and Analysis
Conduct a comprehensive dataset analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the 14 attributes. The attributes are as follows, with the dabatasesâ€™ respective attribute name shortcut included in parentheses:
Age (age)
Sex (sex)
Chest pain type (cp)
Resting blood pressure (trestbps) 
Serum cholesterol (chol)
Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)
Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
Exercise-induced angina (exang)
ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak)
The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)
Number of major vessels (ca) colored by fluoroscopy
Thalassemia (thal)
Presence of heart disease (num). 

The preprocessing phase will address data cleaning, normalization, and handling any missing values, ensuring data integrity for model training.

Model Development and Training:
Random Forest Classification: 
Develop a Random Forest Classifier to predict the presence of heart disease based on the 14 selected attributes.

Neural Network Classification: 
Implement a Neural Network Classifier, designing an architecture that accommodates the input features and outputs a binary prediction of heart disease presence.

Logistic Regression: 
Apply Logistic Regression to model the probability of heart disease presence as a function of the 14 attributes. This approach will include the evaluation of model coefficients to interpret the influence of each feature.

Model Evaluation and Comparison: 
Utilize a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC, to evaluate and compare the performance of the three models. This analysis will provide insights into each model's strengths and weaknesses in the context of heart disease prediction.

Feature Importance Analysis: 
Analyze the models' most influential features in predicting heart disease. This will involve examining model coefficients and feature importance scores generated by the Random Forest and Neural Network models.

Cost Analysis: 
Review the "Test Costs" data to incorporate cost-sensitive learning approaches. This analysis will ensure that the models prioritize prediction accuracy and consider the practical aspects of medical testing costs.

Deliverables
Processed Dataset: 
A cleaned and normalized dataset ready for ML applications.

Model Code and Documentation: 
Complete source code for each ML model, along with detailed documentation on the model architecture, training process, and hyperparameter settings.

Comparison Report: 
A comprehensive report detailing the performance comparison of the three models, including a discussion on the predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and feature importance findings.

Presentation:
A summary of the research findings, suitable for academic and professional audiences, highlighting key insights and recommendations for future work.
